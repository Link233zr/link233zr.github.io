<!-- ==========  HERO SECTION  ========== -->
<!-- Change the paragraphs below to introduce yourself. -->
I am a final-year PhD cadidate in mathematical logic at Cornell. I’ve spent years absorbed in the structure and beauty of mathematics, especially descriptive set theory. 
Now, I'm pivoting to industry research roles — where mathematical insight, algorithmic precision, and logical rigor intersect. I’m excited to apply these skills to real-world challenges and make an impact beyond academia. 

Outside of mathematics, I have a deep appreciation for art, cinema and museums. 
I'm particularly moved by films and artworks that linger on memory, time, and the edge of perception — scenes where people and places drift together across distance or decades. 
I think often about reality, beauty, and truth — not as fixed things to define, but as questions that keep unfolding the more closely I look. These moments of abstraction feel very close to what draws me to math.
