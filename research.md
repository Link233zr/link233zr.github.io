## Research Interests

I'm interested in undersatnding the descriptive set theoretic structures of objects from other areas of mathematics.

* Descriptive set theoretic complxity of Lascar strong types from model theory  
* Analytic P-ideals, their Tukey/Borel-reducibility structures, and essential appilcations to Polish modules
* Puzzles about foundamental mathemitical objects, such as sets, natural numbers, linears orders and etc

Question: Consider the real number R as Q-vector space, take two uncountable Borel Q-vector subspaces of it. Abstractly these spaces are linearly isomorphic because they have the same cardinality. If we require isomorphisms to be Borel, is it true that they are still isomophic? 

## Papers and Preprints

Polish modules over subrings of Q, *Israel J. Math.*, accepted; joint with S. Solecki [\[pdf\]](/files/Q-subspaces-May2024-fin.pdf)

## Other PDFs

I have a short note about a classical example of non-G-compact theory due to Ziegler.[\[pdf\]](/files/Notes_on_Ziegler_s_Example.pdf)
